## ⚠️ Critical Findings

### 🔴 Italian Language Cards - CDN Coverage Issue

**The most critical finding** is that the Italian language version of Set 002 has **severely limited coverage** on the Dreamborn CDN:

- Only **~11% of Italian cards are available** (24 out of 216)
- This affects production usability for Italian users
- The script attempted to download each missing card 3 times before failing

#### Missing Italian Card Ranges:
```
001-097   (97 cards)
100-104   (5 cards)
106-113   (8 cards)
115-187   (73 cards)
189-197   (9 cards)
202       (1 card)
204-216   (13 cards)
---
Total: 192 missing cards
```

#### Available Italian Cards:
```
098, 099, 105, 114, 188, 198, 199, 200, 201, 203
Total: 10 cards only
```

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **🔴 Priority 1: Italian Card Acquisition**
   - Find alternative source for Italian Set 002 cards
   - Consider Ravensburg CDN or manual acquisition
   - Re-run script with different `downloadSource` setting

2. **🟡 Priority 2: Verify Fixed Cards**
   - Spot-check DE/FR cards 205-216 to ensure quality
   - Verify art_and_name crops are visually correct
   - Confirm AVIF quality is acceptable

3. **🟢 Priority 3: Documentation**
   - Update card availability matrix for Set 002
   - Document known Italian language gaps
   - Create tracking issue for missing IT cards

### Script Configuration Changes

To investigate alternative sources for Italian cards:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  edition: "002",
  languages: ["IT"], // Focus on Italian only
  cardRange: { start: 1, end: 216 },
  autoFix: true,
  downloadSource: "ravensburg", // Try alternative CDN
  verbose: true, // Enable detailed logging
  tolerancePx: 2
};
```

## 📊 Comparison with Other Sets

Based on previous validation reports in the repository:

| Set | EN Status | IT Status | DE Status | FR Status |
|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 002 | ✅ Perfect | ❌ 89% missing | ✅ Fixed | ✅ Fixed |
| 003 | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| 004 | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |
| 009 | ✅ Perfect | ⚠️ Few missing | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete |

**Pattern Identified**: Italian language cards have historically lower CDN coverage across multiple sets.
