## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue Found

### Dimension Problem
Lorcast images have **different dimensions**:
- **Actual**: 674√ó940 pixels
- **Expected**: 734√ó1024 pixels

This causes the cropping/variant generation to fail for all downloaded images.

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Original files download successfully
- ‚ùå art_only variants fail (wrong dimensions for cropping)
- ‚ùå art_and_name variants fail (wrong dimensions for cropping)
- ‚ùå AVIF conversions incomplete

## üìä Detailed Statistics

### Cards Downloaded (129 cards)
Successfully downloaded from Lorcast, but variants need to be fixed.

### Cards NOT in Lorcast (65 cards)
These cards are missing from the Lorcast 010.json file:
- 83 attempts failed √ó 3 retries = 249 errors
- Approximately 65 unique cards missing

### Dimension Issues (43 cards)
Cards downloaded but with wrong dimensions:
- All 129 downloaded cards have 674√ó940 instead of 734√ó1024
- Cropping fails because source dimensions don't match expectations

## üí° Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate Fix**: Update Dimension Expectations
The verify-and-fix script should:
- Accept 674√ó940 as valid dimensions for Lorcast sources
- Resize images to 734√ó1024 after download
- OR: Update cropping logic to work with 674√ó940

### 2. **Update Cropping Logic**
Modify the crop function to:
- Detect source dimensions
- Calculate proportional crop regions
- Support both 734√ó1024 (Dreamborn/Ravensburg) and 674√ó940 (Lorcast)

### 3. **Missing Cards**
For the 65 cards not in Lorcast:
- Try Dreamborn or Ravensburg as fallback
- Check if they're promo/special cards outside the normal numbering

## üéâ Success Story

Despite the dimension issues, Lorcast provided **129 out of 151 available cards** - that's **85% coverage** of what they have!

This is a massive improvement over:
- Dreamborn: 24 cards (11%)
- Ravensburg: 54 cards (25%)
