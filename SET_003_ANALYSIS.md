## 🔍 Issues Analysis

### Card IT/003/004 - Download Failed

**Problem**: Italian version of card #004 is not available on Dreamborn CDN

**Error Details:**
```
[05:43:43] [ERROR] Download failed: https://cdn.dreamborn.ink/images/it/cards/003-004 - Status: 404
[05:43:43] [ERROR] Failed to fix 004 (IT): download - Request Failed With Status Code: 404
```

**Attempted**: 3 retry attempts (max configured)

**Impact**:
- Cannot create IT/003/004.webp (original)
- Cannot create IT/003/004.avif (original AVIF)
- Cannot create IT/003/art_and_name/004.webp (cropped variant)
- Cannot create IT/003/art_and_name/004.avif (cropped AVIF)

**Note**: Card #004 exists in EN, DE, and FR, confirming this is an IT-specific CDN issue.

**Recommendation**: 
1. Check if card was later released/added to CDN
2. Manually obtain IT version if available
3. As workaround, could use EN version temporarily (though text would be wrong)

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The script successfully performed the following operations for Italian cards (excluding #004):

### Phase 1: Italian Original Files
- **Downloaded**: 221 missing IT WebP originals from CDN
- **Generated**: 221 AVIF conversions from WebP originals
- **Verified**: All dimensions correct (734×1024px with ±2px tolerance)

### Phase 2: Italian art_and_name Variants
- **Cropped**: 221 art_and_name WebP files (734×767px)
  - Removed text box while keeping card name
  - Maintained proper aspect ratio
- **Generated**: 221 art_and_name AVIF conversions
- **Verified**: All cropped dimensions correct

### Phase 3: Shared art_only Variants (from EN)
- **Status**: Already existed (processed in previous runs)
- **Verified**: All 222 art_only files present
- **Dimensions**: 734×603px (art only, no text or name)
